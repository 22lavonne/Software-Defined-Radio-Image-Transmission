TODO:
- add table of images, probably use the test images from the image detection directory
    - seems like I will have to make another script that will search for and load in the images
    - I can probably reuse code that Tyler wrote that already does this, except now in php
    - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33588691/put-all-images-from-directory-into-html
    - Figure out how to embed a php file in an html file
- figure out how to load this page onto the python script
- maybe generate a nice html format from chatgpt?
- maybe add a section where the authentication will go
